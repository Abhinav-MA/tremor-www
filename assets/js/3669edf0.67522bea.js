In a nutshell, coordinated-omission is where a benchmarking tool ( usually unintentionally ) incorrectly records events under measurement time spans by failing to record the intended verses actual time to record. Specifically, it is insufficient to record the start time and end time of a particular event of interest. Capturing the start and end time allows the delta or servicing time to be computed. It does not capture any synchronization overhead, waiting time, delays or other system-induced hiccups introduced between up to the point the event should have started.

By selecting a fixed static frequency any measured hiccups should be outside of the control of the benchmark framework - they are either artifacts of the scenario under test, or the system upon which it is being tested.
